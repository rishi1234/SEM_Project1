0 A.D. 
=========
	
0 A.D. is a free, open-source, historical Real Time Strategy (RTS) game under development by Wildfire Games. The game focuses on historical war and economy between 500 B.C. and A.D. 500. The concept behind 0 A.D. has actually been in the works since year 2000. In 2002 The Last Alliance (TLA) unified their ideas into a concept of a freeware, an independent game engine to support 0 A.D. After months of collaborative research, a game design document was finalized in the summer of 2003. 

Between 2003 to 2009, the game developed mostly in the art area, with a large number of units and textures designed from scratch, mostly for the Europe and Greek factions. Progress on the programming side was achieved on issues like game play logic, random map generation, water rendering, and multiplayer networking. Although contributions to 0 A.D. was less over these years as interest in TLA waned over time. 

Over time, programmers for 0 A.D. were becoming hard to find and stalling development of the game. The development continued as a closed-source until 2009, as it was supposed to be offered at no charge, yet the source code was closed for team members only. In 2009, the team re-evaluated the development system, and looked into an open source model. Finally they went for it. In July 2009, the project switched from a closed development process to open source, making the code available as General Public License (GPL) and the art content available as Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike (CC-BY-SA), and encouraging external contributions. The team tried to attract new talent to share some ideas with the game development group, and simplify a number of issues in the game. There were around ten to fifteen people working in 0 A.D. but since the development as started there have been over 100 people who have contributed.

As of September 2012, development of TLA has been officially discontinued. All the existing contributions to that project have been archived, and as inspiration for those interested in fantasy mods and games. The game has attracted many contributors in various field of development. On 5 September 2013 a Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign was started with a USD $160,000 goal. It raised a total of $33,251, which is used to hire a programmer. 

The game is available for various platforms like GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It Requires 1.4 GB of memory on hard disk, 512 MB RAM and at least 128 MB graphic card to play. There are roughly around 150K lines of C++ code for the game engine and 25K lines of code for editing tools. Gameplay scripting uses JavaScript. Shortly after the Open Source release, the pre-alpha versions of 0 A.D. was released every two to three months, each with new features, and drawing the project closer to finish step by step. 0 A.D. is in alpha phase, which is an early experimental phase. Till date 0 A.D. has released 16 alpha versions with each version adding new features. It is playable, and can be downloaded, some features like lag in the game, opponents can't use the ships are still missing. 0 A.D. is still officially not released and after implementing all the features, an extensive beta testing should be done.
