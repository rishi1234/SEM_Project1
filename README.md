0 A.D. 
=========

#### Introduction 	
0 A.D. is a free, open-source, historical Real Time Strategy (RTS) game under development by Wildfire Games. The game focuses on historical war and economy between 500 B.C. and A.D. 500. It features gameplay components of building base, training an army, combat, and technology research. 

#### History
The concept behind 0 A.D. has actually been in the works since year 2000. In 2002 The Last Alliance (TLA) unified their ideas into a concept of a freeware, an independent game engine to support 0 A.D. After months of collaborative research, a game design document was finalized in the summer of 2003. Between 2003 to 2009, the game developed mostly in the art area, with a large number of units and textures designed from scratch, mostly for the Europe and Greek factions. Progress on the programming side was achieved on issues like game play logic, random map generation, water rendering, and multiplayer networking.

Over time, programmers for 0 A.D. were becoming hard to find and stalling development of the game. The development continued as a closed-source until 2009, as it was supposed to be offered at no charge, yet the source code was closed for team members only. In 2009, the team re-evaluated the development system, and looked into an open source model. Finally they went for it. In July 2009, the project switched from a closed development process to open source, making the code available as General Public License (GPL) and the art content available as Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike (CC-BY-SA), and encouraging external contributions. The team tried to attract new talent to share some ideas with the game development group, and simplify a number of issues in the game. There were around ten to fifteen people working in 0 A.D. but since the development as started there have been over 100 people who have contributed.

#### Versions
Shortly after the Open Source release, the pre-alpha versions of 0 A.D. was released every two to three months, each with new features, and drawing the project closer to finish step by step. Till date 0 A.D. has released 16 alpha versions with successive release number (1,2,3,..), and a word relating to the ancient world in alphabetical order (Argonaut,Bellerophon,Cerberus,..).

Below are the Major Alpha version which are worthy mentioning:

There are roughly around 150K lines of C++ code for the game engine and 25K lines of code for editing tools. Gameplay scripting is done using JavaScript. On 5 September 2013 a Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign was started with a USD $160,000 goal. It raised a total of $33,251, which is used to hire a programmer.

#### Future Scope
 0 A.D. is still in Evolution stage ( Alpha phase), which is an early experimental phase. It is playable, and can be downloaded, some features like lag in the game, opponents can't use the ships are still missing. 0 A.D. is still officially not released and after implementing all the features, an extensive beta testing should be done.
